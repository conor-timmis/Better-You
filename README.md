This repository contains the frontend code for the Better You website. The backend Django Rest Framework API repository can be found [here](https://github.com/conor-timmis/Better-You-API). The frontend is built using React, React-Bootstrap, JavaScript, JSX, and is hosted on Heroku.

Welcome to Better You, the social platform dedicated to anybody looking to further themselves in the self-improvement space. This is a varied topic but aimed towards you and like-minded others who would like to better themselves, take on life from a whole new perspective, and gain experiences in ways they never thought possible. Better You, as a site, is a social media website, but heavily focused on self-improvement. As much as it is a broad subject, it has been simplified to stay within the relevant categories of the topic. I have built this as someone who has gone through something very similar over the last few years and experienced major changes in my life to get to this point. As a brief summary, I used to be the person who thought going outside was boring, and gaming was everything. But these days, it's the total opposite. It was definitely not an easy challenge to overcome, but I gained all kinds of new confidence and experienced many things, whether at work, at home, or outside in my free time. I cannot recommend enough that anyone take a similar path, even if the circumstances are not exactly the same, and see what is out there for yourself!

## 3. Requirement Gathering and Planning

### Brief Competitor Analysis and Target Demographic

When analysing competitors in the realm of online portfolio platforms for artists, several notable options come to mind:

-   Instagram is widely used by influencers and individuals in the self-improvement niche to share motivational content, personal growth stories, and wellness tips. However, its broad focus on various content types makes it less specialized for dedicated personal development journeys and lacks built-in tools to track progress or growth.
-   Coach.me is a platform that combines personal goal-setting with community support. It offers coaching services and goal tracking to help users develop new habits. However, its interaction is more focused on coaching and less on community-building for like-minded individuals to share their journeys.
-   Mindvalley provides personal growth courses, workshops, and events, focusing on holistic self-improvement across various domains like health, spirituality, and career. Though highly specialized in content, it is primarily a learning platform rather than a social space for user interaction and community building.

In this landscape, Better You aims to carve out a unique niche by offering a dedicated platform specifically for individuals focused on personal growth. It provides a community-driven environment where users can not only share their self-improvement journeys but also interact with like-minded individuals, gain inspiration, and offer support to one another. The goal is to foster a specialized community that encourages personal development, making Better You an ideal platform for those looking to enhance their lives in a targeted, supportive, and motivational setting.

### React Components

| **Component**          | **Purpose**                                                                 |

### API Integration

The HTTP requests specifications have been defined in detail, in the backend API README, [here](https://github.com/conor-timmis/Better-You-API). These formats have been used.

**Authentication Mechanism**
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used for token-based authentication.

**Cross-Origin Resourcer Sharing (CORS)**
CORS is configured on the Django backend to allow requests from this React frontend. This has been done using the `django-cors-headers` package which will handle those settings.

**Data Fetching and State Management**
Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the DJango REST API backend.

React Context and Hooks are used for simple state management.

### Data Validation

Comprehensive data format specifications are available in the API repository's README. This frontend ensures that only valid data is sent to the back end by performing field-level validation before submitting any requests.

### Error Messaging

The Django REST API back end will return relevant HTTP status codes, allowing the React front end to show clear error messages to users, which helps them identify and fix problems. However, since the front end is designed to avoid situations that could cause 400, 404, or other errors, only a limited number of error messages are needed. The API error codes are documented to assist with any direct API access or use by different front ends.                                                                                       |
